## Frequently Asked Questions

### Core Platform Questions

#### Radicle vs. GitHub/GitLab

How is Radicle different from GitHub or GitLab?

Radicle is fundamentally different because it's built on a peer-to-peer architecture. There is no central server or company controlling your data. Your repositories exist on your device and are shared directly with collaborators.

#### Offline Usage

Do I need an internet connection to use Radicle?

No, you can work completely offline. When you connect to the internet, you can sync with your peers to share updates.

#### Open Source Status

Is Radicle Desktop open source?

Yes, Radicle Desktop is entirely open source. You can find the source code on the Radicle network itself or on GitHub.

### Common Technical Issues

#### Connection Troubleshooting

How do I troubleshoot connection issues with my Radicle node?

If you're experiencing connection issues, try: (1) check the node status indicator, (2) restart the app, (3) ensure your firewall isn't blocking port 8776, and (4) verify your internet connection. Enable debug mode in settings for detailed logs.

#### Multi-Device Identity

Can I use the same Radicle identity on multiple devices?

Currently, each device requires its own Radicle identity. The team is working on proper multi-device support. For now, create separate identities for each device.

#### Repository Visibility

Why can't others see my repository after I've pushed it?

For others to see your repository: ensure your node is online, verify your repositories are being properly seeded, share your Repository ID (RID), and consider having your repository picked up by a seed node for better availability.

### Platform & Usage

#### Windows Support

Does Radicle Desktop support Windows?

Currently, Radicle Desktop supports Linux and macOS. Windows support is planned for the future based on community demand.

#### GitHub Migration

How do I migrate repositories from GitHub to Radicle?

Clone your GitHub repository locally, initialize it as a Radicle repository using the desktop app, then push it to the network. Full migration tooling for issues and pull requests is planned.
